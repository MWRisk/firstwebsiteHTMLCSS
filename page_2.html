                <p>IT provides the backbone of the modern business. Simply put, they would find it almost impossible to function without some form of IT. The use of IT is pivotal across all elements of business, from sales and marketing through to infrastructure.
                <br>
                <br>People generally take things for granted now but all consumers have technology that influence purchase options and computers and programs are a given in any office. IT makes the storing of information more condensed and easier to access, allows communication to happen across multiple locations and channels and allows complicated processes to be streamlined and resource efficient.

                <h3 class="mup_txt">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
                <p>Modern digital projects rely on a project management methodology, a range of skills (tech and non-tech), resources (money, time, people, technology). Seemingly the most adopted digital project management methodology is Agile, with Kanban and Scrum the workflow frameworks that appear most common.
                <br>
                <br>In order to complete digital projects in an efficient way you would need good tools to complete the task. This ranges from hardware to specific communication and workflow management tools. Good examples of the latter would be Slack (communication) and Trello (workflow visualisation tool).

                <h3 class="mup_txt">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>
                <p>When planning out tasks in IT, my approach will be to utilise a work management tool (Trello) from the outset. Initially identifying timeframes, resource and product proposition, I would design a work/process flow chart then break down the components of the project into smaller objectives.
                <br>
                <br>Listing the smaller components on Trello in ascending order of importance and then working on finishing one item at a time according to the work flow.</p>

                <h3 class="mup_txt">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
                <p>Generally, the major reasons for projects failing is based on time, resource, skills and money. If a project is poorly scoped or planned, it will be significantly harder to succeed
                <br>
                <br>If critical components of the project are not completed, either because a proper cost/risk assessment hasn't been done, the wrong skills/technology is employed or there isn't a solution to that specific problem, then this can be a fatal problem. Another issue is skills based - if you lose technical knowledge that is key to the project, and the correct documentation isn't in place.</p>
