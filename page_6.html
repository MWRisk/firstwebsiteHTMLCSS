            <p>###Completely happy with the choice of tools. Trello has been really useful for task management and visual studio seems to support the project really well. I made a mistake by not storing files on github as somehow I managed to delete the most recent file of one of my pages and wasn't able to use github to retrieve it, given I hadn't backed it up...</p>

            <h3 class="harry_txt">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
            <p>####The tools used seem highly appropriate. Visual studio allowing access to image files and CSS files for styling is great and Trello has allowed me to keep track of details for use within the website in advance of inserting them into the HTML code.</p>
