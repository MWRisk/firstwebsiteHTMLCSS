            <h3 class="harry_txt">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
            <p>The systems and tools used are definitely fit for purpose. Using Github to back up versions of my code was occasionally time consuming - had I known how to use Git (Bash) this could have been far more efficient. Visual studio as always has been great to use and Trello has helped identify important tasks and break down the components. Having been exposed to HTML/CSS only a few days ago, I imagine that it would have been a lot more efficient to have some more prior knowledge. Working in teams could have made the production of the website more efficient, as the code components could have been shared i.e. one person codes the nav bar, one person codes a button etc. The core backbone of the site could have been constructed jointly and the personalised styling elements separately.</p>

            <h3 class="harry_txt">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
            <p>The tools used seem highly appropriate. Visual studio allowing access to image files and CSS files for styling is great and Trello has allowed me to keep track of details for use within the website in advance of inserting them into the HTML code.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="harry_txt">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
            <p> Gonna be inserting a decent chunk of information here
