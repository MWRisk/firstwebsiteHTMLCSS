            <h3 class="GoT_txt">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
            <p>There are a huge number of criteria that you may wish to consider with regards to choosing the right kind of technology for the job...
            <br>
            <br>As always, time, money and resource play heavy parts in the decision process. The size and complexity of the task have to be taken into account, as does the amount of time you wish to complete a project or how fast you wish to produce output in a job.
            <br>
            <br>If the "job" is isolated, has no reliance on other technologies then most likely you want to use the fastest/cheapest technology available - the exception being if you may wish to make future modification or scale the project/job.
            <br>
            <br>In larger more complex projects you have to think more carefully about flexibility, scalability, availability and cost of resource that will "interact" with the tech, future proofing and how the tools you are considering will interact with each other.

            <h3 class="GoT_txt">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control:</h3>
            <p>The technologies chosen to help with my project are Trello, Visual studio and Github/Git:
            <br>
            <br>Trello is a visual workflow management tool that allows users to break down their project into smaller chunks on each card, with a view to focusing on one project at a time and improving efficiency. It allows me to plan more effectively and also to add notes and descriptions to existing project cards or review tasks that are "complete". I have found Trello amazing for me as a tool - it helps me stay task focused and I get a little intrinsic reward every time I move a card into the done list.
            <br>
            <br>Visual Studio is the integrated development environment I will be using to code HTML and CSS for the website development.
            <br>
            <br>Git distributed version-control system. It is a repository for code and allows an individual or team to make changes to projects, whilst maintaining previous versions of the code. Github is the service hosting for Git that I have chosen. This will allow me to make revisions to my code, share any problems with people to enhance my understanding and be able to revert to earlier versions should I encounter problems (either scale or incorrect code).

        <h3 class="GoT_txt">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
        <p>The general data protection regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation requiring anyone to protect customers/individuals from harmful or unwanted outcomes of the use of their data. Personal data is considered anything that is from an identified or identifiable person. This could be a single piece of information or a collection of information that could make an individual identifiable.
        <br>
        <br>In the case of personal "from home" projects, the regulation is fairly ambiguous, stating that GDPR does not apply unless there is a link to commercial or financial benefit, in which case it would fall under GDPR.
        <br>
        <br>Any project that may involve data input or has mechanisms that store data (cookies) will need to be highly mindful of the GDPR regulations. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines from the EU. 
        <br>
        <br>The highest fine so far (up to 20th Jan 2020) is 50 million Euros, imposed by the French data regulator on Google, for alleged transparency principles infringement and lack of consent, rather than a data breach.
